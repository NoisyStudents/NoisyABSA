441,"Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food, and there was no one to recommend any wine."
442,"The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush, this is not the place for you."
443,"No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town, Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination."
444,i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too.

494,THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS.
495,IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL.
496,It took 100 years for Parisi to get around to making pizza (at least I don't think they ever made it before this year)...but it was worth the wait.
497,I asked for a simple medium rare steak.
498,"Generously garnished, organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish, but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious."
499,"Probably my worst dining experience in new york, and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about."
500,"Result (red velvet): Great texture, soft and velvety, nice hint of cocoa."
501,Ask for the round corner table next to the large window.
502,"Their twist on pizza is heatlhy, but full of flavor."
503,The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies (although everyone is polite and no one is pushing) is a slight turn off.
504,"I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people."
505,"Unfortunately, unless you live in the neighborhood, it's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure."
506,Didn't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food.
507,The food--though mostly deep-fried--is simple and satisfying.

512,"The other times I've gone it's romantic date heaven, you can walk in get a booth by the windows, be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded place, with great food and service."
513,I would only go for the coffee which is way better than Starbucks or the like.
514,I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it.
515,Somewhat disappointing wine list (only new vintages.
516,"Both were very good, but nothing you couldn't get at similar restaurant."
517,If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$$ this is the place to be!!
518,new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than big mac!
519,"Perfectly al dente pasta, not drowned in sauce -- generous portions."
520,"I can understand the prices if it served better food, like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area."
521,Service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night.

525,perfect for a quick meal.

531,Have a mojito and sit in the back patio.
532,The service was dreadfully slow (the place was only half full) and a smile would have been nice...

535,"So we sat at the bar, the bartender didn't seem like he wanted to be there."
536,"I reccomend the fried pork dumplings, the orange chicken/beef, and the fried rice."
537,You will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menu.
538,The french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific!
539,"Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for?"
540,The boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposeing.
541,"If you're lucky and there's not a private party going on back there, you'll get a chance to really chill out."
542,They also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare.
543,"Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious."
544,"Disappointingly, their wonderful Saketini has been taken off the bar menu."
545,In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a look that's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch.
546,I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard.
547,They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip.
548,then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people.
549,"The happy hour is so cheap, but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere."
550,"After waiting for almost an hour, the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order."
551,With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere.
552,"A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there space for its quick, tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices."
553,"Give it a try, menu is typical French but varied."
554,It gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice.
555,"but for the value, it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group."
556,the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they can't compete with Temple's entire positive attitude about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality food.
557,We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came.
558,"It was good, but none of the flavors WOW."

563,The space is traditional in feel.
564,"the restaurant was completely empty, but she gave me a dirty look and asked, no reservations?"
565,the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.
566,"Good service, great food, good value, and never have to wait in line!"
567,Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast.
568,"I have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant."
569,"The music was fascinating, but left room for conversation, and the bartender made superb drinks."
570,rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $2 and you're set for the night!
571,Cuisine is billed as asian fusion - doesn't meet the bill.
572,Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu.
573,"Dishes denoted as ""Roy's Classics"" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs."
574,"The cold sesame noodles, which are a freebie when you order $10+, are delectable."
575,"I came to fresh expecting a great meal, and all I got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we couldn't enjoy eating."
576,The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sausage like the ones that sell for $2.99/lb at the store.
577,"I went to Swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner, but nothing amazing."
578,"Best Chinese on the Upper East, prompt delivery, good value."
579,Most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonaise which is actually pretty good.

581,It's worthwhile to take a cab to Chelsea just for an awesome dinner at My Chelsea.
582,"Not only is the food authentic, but the staff here are practically off-the-boat, they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine."
583,"It has good music, nice tapas, an interesting selection of wines (primarily Spanish) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele."
584,"The food is great, I love their dumplings, cold sesame noodles, chicken and shrimp dishs."
585,"And the food, well the food will keep you coming back."
586,Waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well.
587,It's the conversations that make this a fun place to be.
588,"My gf's duck confitte was very solid as well, although i have little base of reference."

594,We had a birthday party here recently and the food and service was amazing.
595,"the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees, including fresh seafood and huge steaks, there's also a couple of non-meat alternatives."
596,This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food.
597,"The appetizers are ok, but the service is slow."
598,the food - not worth the price.
599,"What can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree, then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back (which she did politely, by the way)."
600,The prices are not terrible.
601,15% gratuity automatically added to the bill.
602,"The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the meal."
603,Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack.
604,Both a number of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing.
605,"All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available."
606,"Although somewhat loud, the noise was minimally intrusive."
607,"It's a basic pizza joint, not much to look at, but the pizza is what I go for."
608,"Tables are close, so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons."
609,Was her Monday for lunch - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel.
610,"Not too much so, but enough that there's a great scene."
611,You feel like you made it to New York when you eat here.
612,We'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a Monday night.

616,We spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left.

618,"Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, carrots and other vegetables and spices."
619,"At peak times, the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close."
620,The service was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz?
621,"Menus feature seasonal picks, like sweet corn-foie gras brulee."
622,"Innovations are just as assured, from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce."
623,"And these are not small, wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real, full sized patties."
624,"There restaurant is very casual, but perfect for lunch, and their delivery service is always very fast."
625,Chinatown definitely has better quality with cheaper prices.
626,I had to flag down a third staff person for a fork... so now it's goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company.

665,"We had tons of great food, wine, and desserts."

667,"OK, I've been to Dumont a few times now."
668,The food really isn't very good and the service is terrible.
669,"Maybe it's that most of Dumont's patrons are younger and have lower expectations, but I cannot recommend Dumont."
670,"Not only do they have the best escargot in town,they always try to accomodate our toddler."
671,"I've been to Sotto Voce several time, and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time!"
672,"Between my guest and I, we sampled at least 80% of the menu, and they were all hits."

688,"Great burgers, grilled cheeses and french fries."
689,The Yellowfin Tuna and Calf's liver are my favorites!
690,Sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth.
691,But make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet.
692,Despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick I also love.
693,They bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (I tried them ALL).
694,"Not only was the sushi fresh, they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the duck!"
695,good variety but nothing surprising.
696,"After I paid for my purchase, I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my pie."

708,The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.
709,"We requested they re-slice the sushi, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes."
710,"The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game."

441,"Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food, and there was no one to recommend any wine."
442,"The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush, this is not the place for you."
443,"No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town, Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination."
444,i would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too.

454,My daughter and I left feeling satisfied (not stuffed) and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch.
455,I'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so I can keep the crowds away...been going there on and off for a year now and it's really my fave hang out in the city.

494,THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS.
495,IT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND WANTED AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN MEAL.
496,It took 100 years for Parisi to get around to making pizza (at least I don't think they ever made it before this year)...but it was worth the wait.
497,I asked for a simple medium rare steak.
498,"Generously garnished, organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish, but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious."
499,"Probably my worst dining experience in new york, and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about."
500,"Result (red velvet): Great texture, soft and velvety, nice hint of cocoa."
501,Ask for the round corner table next to the large window.
502,"Their twist on pizza is heatlhy, but full of flavor."
503,The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies (although everyone is polite and no one is pushing) is a slight turn off.
504,"I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people."
505,"Unfortunately, unless you live in the neighborhood, it's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure."
506,Didn't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food.
507,The food--though mostly deep-fried--is simple and satisfying.
508,We live in the neighborhood and have been going there twice a week since the day they first opened.

511,At night the atmoshere changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered.
512,"The other times I've gone it's romantic date heaven, you can walk in get a booth by the windows, be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded place, with great food and service."
513,I would only go for the coffee which is way better than Starbucks or the like.
514,I used to be a regular costumer at pongal until dosa hut opened right next door to it.
515,Somewhat disappointing wine list (only new vintages.
516,"Both were very good, but nothing you couldn't get at similar restaurant."
517,If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$$ this is the place to be!!
518,new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than big mac!
519,"Perfectly al dente pasta, not drowned in sauce -- generous portions."
520,"I can understand the prices if it served better food, like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area."
521,Service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night.
522,"To the owners; good job guys, this place is a keeper!"
523,and the owner is simply lovely and friendly.
524,This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming.
525,perfect for a quick meal.
526,Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events.
527,"The service was great, and they have a whole great deal for birthdays."
528,The staff is 100% Italian and the food is as authentic as it gets.
529,My only complaint might be the fortune cookies - I've never had a cookie predict bad luck for me before I visited Kar.
530,Good for a quick sushi lunch.
531,Have a mojito and sit in the back patio.
532,The service was dreadfully slow (the place was only half full) and a smile would have been nice...
533,I went this past Saturday and had a excellent meal of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes.
534,The waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch!!!!!
535,"So we sat at the bar, the bartender didn't seem like he wanted to be there."
536,"I reccomend the fried pork dumplings, the orange chicken/beef, and the fried rice."
537,You will not be dissapointed by any of the choices in the menu.
538,The french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific!
539,"Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for?"
540,The boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposeing.
541,"If you're lucky and there's not a private party going on back there, you'll get a chance to really chill out."
542,They also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare.
543,"Fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious."
544,"Disappointingly, their wonderful Saketini has been taken off the bar menu."
545,In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a look that's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch.
546,I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard.
547,They are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip.
548,then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people.
549,"The happy hour is so cheap, but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere."
550,"After waiting for almost an hour, the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order."
551,With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere.
552,"A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there space for its quick, tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices."
553,"Give it a try, menu is typical French but varied."
554,It gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice.
555,"but for the value, it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group."
556,the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they can't compete with Temple's entire positive attitude about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality food.
557,We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came.
558,"It was good, but none of the flavors WOW."
559,"Overall, this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent."
560,Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant price.
561,"Actually, everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed."
562,"for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito (or tacos), margarita, and dessert."
563,The space is traditional in feel.
564,"the restaurant was completely empty, but she gave me a dirty look and asked, no reservations?"
565,the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.
566,"Good service, great food, good value, and never have to wait in line!"
567,Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast.
568,"I have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant."
569,"The music was fascinating, but left room for conversation, and the bartender made superb drinks."
570,rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $2 and you're set for the night!
571,Cuisine is billed as asian fusion - doesn't meet the bill.
